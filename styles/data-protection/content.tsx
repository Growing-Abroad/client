      <h3>2.1 Collection and storage</h3>

      <ul>

        <li>you submit an application to us,</li>
        <li>we contact you for the first time on the basis of your applicant profile on applicant portals such as Experteer and/or Indeed, or</li>
        <li>we contact you for the first time based on your profile on professional social media platforms such as LinkedIn and/or XING,</li>
      </ul>

      <p>then we usually collect the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Salutation, first name, last name,</li>
        <li>address,</li>
        <li>a valid e-mail address,</li>

        <li>all other data that you provide in your application documents,</li>
        <li>all other data that you have released in the applicant profile on applicant portals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We assign you a candidate number in our database and store your personal data there.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Where for do we process your data (purpose of processing) and on what legal basis?</h3>
      <p>In the following, we inform you about what we process your data for and on what legal basis.</p>

      <h4>2.2.1. Data processing based on our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) sent. 1 lit. f GDPR)</h4>
      <p>We may also use your data on the basis of a balance of interests to protect the legitimate interests of us or third parties. This is done, for example, for the following purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>For applicant consultation and support and sales</li>
        <li>General business management as a recruitment agency and further development of services</li>
        <li>Advertising, market and opinion research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our interest in the respective processing results from the respective purposes and is otherwise of an economic nature. As far as possible and appropriate, we process your data pseudonymously or anonymously.</p>
      

      <h4>2.2.2. Data processing for the purpose of performing a future or current contract with us (Article 6 (1) sent. 1 lit. b GDPR)</h4>
      <p>We process your data to carry out contractual obligations and pre-contractual measures with you, i.e. in particular</p>

      <ul>
        <li>for the internal processing of your application</li>
        <li>for correspondence with you</li>
        <li>for contacting you as a job seeker, to contact you at your request and to initiate an application process (recruitment, acquisition measures)</li>
        <li>for conducting an application process, in particular by sending your candidate profile to our customers and coordinating customer interviews</li>
        <li>to conduct application and, if necessary, briefing interviews, e.g. via video call (Microsoft Teams, Zoom)</li>
        <li>to advise you on your career goals</li>
        <li>to advise you on the optimization of your application documents</li>
        <li>to conduct surveys to improve ourselves as a service provider</li>
        <li>to process warranty claims</li>
        <li>to process any liability claims that may exist and to assert any claims against you</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2.2.3. Data processing on the basis of your consent (Article 6 (1) sent. 1 lit. a GDPR)</h4>
      <p>
      For optimal candidate support and in particular for the creation and management of a candidate database and to ensure smooth application processes in the future, we store your data for a period of up to ten years. For this purpose, we require your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a GDPR.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you do not give us consent to store your personal data for a longer period, then we will delete your data after the purpose has been achieved, provided that there are no further reasons for storage, see under point 4. In this case, longer-term candidate support with you is not possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can revoke consent at any time with effect for the future. This also applies to declarations of consent that you gave to us before the GDPR came into force, i.e. before May 25, 2018. We inform you that the revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
      </p>

      <h4>2.2.4. Due to legal requirements (Article 6 (1) sent.1 lit. C GDPR.</h4>
      <p>We are subject to various legal obligations, such as statutory commercial storage and documentation obligations (from HGB, StGB or AO).</p>

    title: "3. Categories of data recipients",
    paragraph: `
      <p>The transfer of personal data is also processing within the meaning of the section 3. However, we would like to inform you separately about the issue of transferring data to third parties. The protection of your personal data is very important to us. For this reason, we are particularly careful when it comes to passing on your data to third parties.
        <br />
        <br />
